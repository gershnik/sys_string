## Integration

### Direct use

This library is header only so the most basic way to use it is to 

* Download the sources
* Set your include path to `lib/inc` 

Note that you need to have your compiler to use at least C++20 mode in order for build to succeed.

### CMake via FetchContent

With modern CMake the easiest way to use this library is

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(sys_string
    GIT_REPOSITORY git@github.com:gershnik/sys_string.git
    GIT_TAG        <desired tag like v3.2>
    GIT_SHALLOW    TRUE
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(sys_string)
...
target_link_libraries(mytarget
PRIVATE
  sys_string::sys_string
)
```
> â„¹&#xFE0F; _[What is FetchContent?](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html)_

### CMake from download

Alternatively, you can clone this repository somewhere and do this:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(<dowload_path>/lib, sys_string)
...
target_link_libraries(mytarget
PRIVATE
  sys_string::sys_string
)
```

Note that you need to have your compiler to default to at least C++17 or set `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to at least 17 in order for build to succeed.

### Building and installing on your system

You can also build and install this library on your system using CMake.

1. Download or clone this repository into SOME_PATH
2. On command line:
```bash
cd SOME_PATH
cmake -S . -B build 
cmake --build build

#Optional
#cmake --build build --target run-test

#install to /usr/local
sudo cmake --install build
#or for a different prefix
#cmake --install build --prefix /usr
```

Once the library has been installed it can be used in the following ways:

#### Basic use 

Set the include directory to `<prefix>/include` where `<prefix>` is the install prefix from above.

#### CMake package

```cmake
find_package(sys_string)

target_link_libraries(mytarget
PRIVATE
  sys_string::sys_string
)
```

#### Via `pkg-config`

Add the output of `pkg-config --cflags sys_string` to your compiler flags.

Note that the default installation prefix `/usr/local` might not be in the list of places your
`pkg-config` looks into. If so you might need to do:
```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/share/pkgconfig
```
before running `pkg-config`

## Configuration options

Whichever method you use you can set the following macros (either on command line or _before_ including any library headers) to control the library behavior:

* `SYS_STRING_NO_S_MACRO` - set it to 1 to disable short `S()` macro. See [Usage](doc/Usage.md#basics) for details
* `SYS_STRING_USE_GENERIC` - set it to 1 to use `const char *` as default `sys_string` storage regardless of platform.
* `SYS_STRING_USE_ICU` - set it to 1 to use ICU instead of internal code for case conversion, normalization and grapheme iteration. ICU headers
  must present on include path and available via `#include <unicode/...>`. You will also need to link with ICU libraries.
* `SYS_STRING_WIN_BSTR` - set it to 1 to use `BSTR` as default `sys_string` storage on Windows. It has no effect on other platforms.
* `SYS_STRING_WIN_HSTRING` - set it to 1 to use `HSTRING` as default `sys_string` storage on Windows. It has no effect on other platforms.
* `SYS_STRING_ENABLE_PYTHON` - set it to 1 to enable Python support. This requires header `<Python.h>` to be available on the include path. If enabled the `sys_string_pystr` and related classes become available. This doesn't change the default `sys_string`.
* `SYS_STRING_USE_PYTHON` - set it to 1 to make Python strings the default `sys_string` storage. This automatically enables `SYS_STRING_ENABLE_PYTHON` and has the same requirements.
